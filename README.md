# Rosemary Wambui â€” Environmental Portfolio

This is a personal portfolio website showcasing my work in environmental conservation, research, and youth engagement. The project demonstrates responsive web design, project presentation, and a functional contact form with client-side validation.

## Purpose
The website highlights:
- My background, skills, and experience in environmental conservation.
- Featured projects, including tree planting, water/soil studies, and youth mobilization.
- Services offered in research, community mobilization, and advocacy.
- A contact form for visitors to reach out.

## Features
- **Responsive Design:** Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- **Mobile Navigation:** Hamburger menu that opens and closes on small screens.
- **Contact Form:** Client-side validation for name, email, and message.
- **Project Showcase:** Projects with images and hover animations.
- **Hover Animations:** Added to `.card` and `.project` sections for interactivity.

## Live Website

## Notes
- All images are stored in the `images/` folder.
- The site uses a single CSS file (`style.css`) and a single JS file (`script.js`) for functionality.
- The contact form is a demo and does not send real emails.
